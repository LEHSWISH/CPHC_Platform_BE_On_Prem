2. Project Structure 
 
Structure: 

    abha-service: Handles all ABHA-related functionalities, including ABHA creation and linking. 

    health-service: Manages health and vitals information. 

    notification-service: Manages all SMS notifications. 

    user-service: Performs CRUD operations, manages user details and passwords, includes ABHA M1 functionality, and integrates tourism APIs. 

    pom.xml: This is the central pom.xml file that contains all dependencies for the various services. It serves as a common configuration file for all services. 

 
 

3. Steps to Run a Maven-Based Application 

# Navigate to the Project Root: 

    Open your terminal or command prompt. 

    Change directory to the project's root where the common pom.xml file is located and install the dependencies by running: 

 

                # Enter in terminal 

                mvn clean install -Djib.skip=true 

 

# Navigate to the Specific Microservice Directory: 

If each microservice is in a separate directory, navigate to the directory of the microservice you want to run (navigate to its pom.xml file) 

 

# Enter in terminal 

mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=dev,common
